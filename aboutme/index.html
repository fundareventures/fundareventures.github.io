  <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 18px; color: #1c2d40;">
    I'm passionate about helping people move from financial stress to financial confidence. As an AFC (Accredited Financial Counselor) candidate, I bring both professional expertise and genuine empathy to every client relationship.
    <br><br>
    Through personalized one-on-one coaching, I support young professionals and families looking to get organized, pay off debt, save purposefully, and invest in their futures. Most of my clients reduce their financial anxiety within just 3 months, with many achieving significant debt reduction and establishing their first emergency funds within 6 months.
    <br><br>
    I also partner with employers who want to offer meaningful financial wellness programs to their teams. These programs can significantly improve employee retention, morale, and focus by reducing financial stress at the root. When employees feel confident about their finances, the entire organization benefits from increased productivity and workplace satisfaction.
    <br><br>
    My coaching philosophy is simple: true financial change comes from understanding both the technical skills and the mindset behind money decisions. What sets my approach apart is the balance between practical tools and emotional support—because money isn't just about numbers, it's about life goals and personal values.
    <br><br>
    I believe in meeting people where they are — offering collaborative, judgment-free support with practical, actionable steps that fit the real lives of busy professionals and growing families. My clients don't just learn to budget; they transform their relationship with money.
    <br><br>
    My journey into financial coaching began after navigating my own financial challenges and realizing how transformative the right guidance can be. The clarity and confidence I gained through organizing my finances inspired me to help others achieve the same peace of mind and financial control that changed my life.
